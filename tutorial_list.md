samsymons | [RE with Radare2, pt1](https://samsymons.com/blog/reverse-engineering-with-radare2-part-1/) | A really good place to start if you're unfamiliar with r2. After you go through the first 2, try to solve the final challenge by yourself
artifical truth | [Defeating ioli with Radare2](https://dustri.org/b/defeating-ioli-with-radare2.html) | This is not a good place to start; the author focuses on solving the challenges very quickly and doesn't hold your hand through it. Good for examining/deducing methodology.
koppian adventures | [The Ioli Crackmes](http://hkopp.github.io/2017/02/the-ioli-crackmes) | Another 'quick and dirty' walkthrough. This has some nice diversions where the author will introduce his own challenges and walk you through them, like patching a crackme binary to accept all passwords.
sure-fire CTF writeups | [0x00](https://github.com/sure-fire/CTF-writeups/blob/master/writeups/crackme/0x00.md) | This guide is great in that it takes one challenge, and solves it 6 different ways, including binary patching and runtime-manipulation in a debugger.
